    "text": "This post highlights a data science project analyzing the real-world impacts of decentralized renewable energy (DRE) technologies in India. Leveraging user-level evidence collected by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), I explored how DRE access varied across gender and states ‚Äî and how it related to reported changes in household income.\nThe analysis aimed to answer: Who is using DRE? and What are the livelihood outcomes? I used R to clean, visualize, and interpret the data, with a focus on two questions: 1. Do women benefit differently from DRE access? 2. How does adoption differ by technology and state?"
