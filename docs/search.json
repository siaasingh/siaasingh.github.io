    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nIn the Global South, millions still lack access to electricity. Extending central grids is often not feasible due to terrain, cost, or infrastructure gaps. Microgrids — decentralized, often solar-powered systems — provide a clean, scalable alternative. This blog post draws from a Q&A-style analysis conducted for ES 145, highlighting microgrids’ role in alleviating energy poverty and mitigating climate change."
