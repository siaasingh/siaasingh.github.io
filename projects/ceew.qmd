## üîç Overview

This post highlights a data science project analyzing the real-world impacts of decentralized renewable energy (DRE) technologies in India. Leveraging user-level evidence collected by the **Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW)**, I explored how DRE access varied across gender and states ‚Äî and how it related to reported changes in household income.

The analysis aimed to answer: _Who is using DRE?_ and _What are the livelihood outcomes?_ I used `R` to clean, visualize, and interpret the data, with a focus on two questions:
1. Do women benefit differently from DRE access?
2. How does adoption differ by technology and state?

## üìä Visualization 1: Income Change by Gender

```r
# Load ggplot2
library(ggplot2)

# Stacked bar chart - income change by gender
ggplot(gender_data, aes(x = Gender, fill = IncomeChange)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(
    title = "Reported Income Change by Gender",
    x = "Gender",
    y = "Percentage of Users",
    fill = "Income Change"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)
```

**Interpretation:** The vast majority of users ‚Äî regardless of gender ‚Äî reported increased income from DRE adoption. Interestingly, women were slightly more likely than men to report financial gain, suggesting DRE may help narrow gender income gaps in rural areas.

## üìä Visualization 2: Technology Type by State

```r
# Horizontal bar chart - DRE tech by state

ggplot(state_data, aes(x = State, fill = Technology)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(
    title = "DRE Technology Adoption by State",
    x = "State",
    y = "Number of Users",
    fill = "Technology"
  ) +
  coord_flip()
```

![](../images/DRE.png){width=500px}

**Interpretation:** This plot shows that different states have adopted different DRE solutions. **Uttar Pradesh** leads in solar refrigerator use, while **Odisha** has widespread adoption of solar pumps. These trends could reflect regional policy support, agriculture needs, and program implementation models.

## üí° Takeaways

- **DRE is working:** Most users reported increased income post-adoption, reinforcing the link between clean energy and livelihoods.
- **Women benefit too:** Female users reported slightly higher income benefits, making a case for scaling gender-inclusive DRE programs.
- **Customization matters:** Adoption patterns vary by region and technology ‚Äî one-size-fits-all programs may miss local needs.
