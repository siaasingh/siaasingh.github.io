## Introduction

In the Global South, millions still lack access to electricity. Extending central grids is often not feasible due to terrain, cost, or infrastructure gaps. Microgrids â€” decentralized, often solar-powered systems â€” provide a clean, scalable alternative. This blog post draws from a Q&A-style analysis conducted for ES 145, highlighting microgridsâ€™ role in alleviating energy poverty and mitigating climate change.

## Key Takeaways

- Microgrids last 7â€“10+ years, with periodic battery replacement being the biggest cost.
- Case studies from India, Nepal, and West Africa show large-scale viability.
- Solar microgrids emit 95% less COâ‚‚ than diesel-based systems.
- Microgrids improve rural incomes, job access, and womenâ€™s empowerment.
- The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) is cheaper for solar microgrids than diesel.
- Please view attached pdf for figures!

## Final Thoughts

Microgrids are not just an interim solution â€” theyâ€™re a cornerstone for energy justice, sustainability, and resilience in the Global South. Backed by supportive policy, local ownership, and sustainable financing, they can align access and mitigation goals for 2030 and beyond.
