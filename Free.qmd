# 🎉 Free For All

Welcome to the fun corner of my website — a space for hobbies, experiences, and anything else that makes me, *me*! 🌟

## 🌊 My Global Dive Sites

Scuba diving has been one of the most incredible ways for me to connect with the underwater world and witness biodiversity up close. Below is a map of the dive sites I've explored around the world — from the reefs of Koh Tao to the shores of Cabo. These are **my personal ratings** based on what I observed during my dives — particularly the **biodiversity** (variety and abundance of marine life) and **coral vibrance** (color, density, and health of coral ecosystems).

I’m always excited to explore more dive sites in the future and hope to expand this map as I keep diving! 🐠💦
