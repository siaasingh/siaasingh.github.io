# 🌊 My Dive Adventures Around the World

As a certified diver, I've been lucky enough to explore stunning underwater ecosystems across the globe. Below is an **interactive map** showcasing the locations where I've dived — along with my **personal ratings** for biodiversity and coral vibrance, based on what I personally experienced. I hope to continue expanding this list and diving in many more amazing locations!

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(leaflet)

# Create a data frame of your dive sites
dives <- data.frame(
  location = c("Great Barrier Reef, Australia", "Andaman & Nicobar Islands, India", "Fiji",
               "Bahamas", "Cancun, Mexico", "Hawaii (Big Island)", "Hawaii (Kauai)",
               "Sri Lanka", "Cabo, Mexico", "Jamaica", "Goa, India", "San Diego, USA",
               "Koh Tao, Thailand", "Menjangan, Indonesia"),
  lat = c(-16.9186, 11.7401, -17.7134, 25.0343, 21.1619, 19.5429, 22.0964,
          7.8731, 22.8894, 18.1096, 15.2993, 32.7157, 10.0982, -8.1086),
  lng = c(145.7781, 92.6586, 178.0650, -77.3963, -86.8515, -155.6659, -159.5261,
          80.7718, -109.9159, -77.2975, 74.1240, -117.1611, 99.8382, 114.5420),
  biodiversity = c(5, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 5, 3, 2, 2, 5, 5),
  coral = c(2, 4, 5, 3, 4, 2, 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, NA, 5, 5),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

# Create popup content with location, biodiversity, and coral ratings
popup_content <- paste0(
  "<strong>", dives$location, "</strong><br>",
  "Biodiversity Rating: ", dives$biodiversity, "/5<br>",
  "Coral Vibrance Rating: ", dives$coral, "/5"
)

# Generate leaflet map
leaflet(dives) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lng = ~lng, lat = ~lat, popup = popup_content)
```

# 🐠 Notes

-   All ratings reflect **my personal experience** based on the day, season, and dive site conditions when I visited.
-   This map is a work in progress — I hope to add more dive sites as I explore new reefs!

Thanks for checking it out! 🌎🐟
