## 🌍 Between Continents

I grew up between India and the Bay Area — and that cross-cultural experience shaped how I see people, place, and the planet.  
It taught me that environmentalism is deeply personal and often rooted in how we connect to community and place.

Travel has been a huge part of my life — from Kerala’s backwaters to Santa Barbara's coastline, I’ve found meaning in motion. Whether it’s through cultural festivals or street food, I love learning about the world through lived experiences.

## 💃 Dance and Movement 

I have always been the type to never sit still. I grew up playing Table Tennis, Soccer and Water Polo. In college I joined UCSB Taara - a nationally competitive bollywood fusion dance team. This has been a great way to connect with my culture while also finding value in movement. I also love working out in particular Yoga Sculpts and hope to become an instructor one day!

## 🌊 Marine Life & SCUBA

Becoming a certified diver opened my eyes to the fragility of marine ecosystems.  
Having now completed over 50 dives, they have helped deepen my commitment to protecting coral reef and island ecosystems.
